# Marketplace Project Documentation

## Overview

The Marketplace project is a private, module-type application leveraging React for building user interfaces, Zustand for state management, and Vite as a build tool. It's set up to use modern development practices, including linting, hot module replacement, and a streamlined development server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with React and modern JavaScript development.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run several scripts defined in the `package.json`:

### `npm run dev`

Launches the development server using Vite. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder using Vite. It optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint to check for code quality and consistency issues in `.js` and `.jsx` files. It reports unused eslint-disable directives and fails on any warnings.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build from the `dist` folder, allowing you to preview the app after it's built.

## Dependencies

- **axios**: Promise based HTTP client for making requests.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from `.env` files into `process.env`.
- **react** & **react-dom**: Core libraries for building React applications.
- **react-router-dom**: Declarative routing for React applications.
- **triplesec**: Encryption library.
- **zustand**: A state management solution.

## Development Dependencies

- **@types/react** & **@types/react-dom**: TypeScript definitions for React and ReactDOM.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Provides React fast refresh and other features for Vite.
- **autoprefixer**: PostCSS plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes.
- **eslint** & related plugins: Linting tools for JavaScript and React.
- **postcss**: Tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript.
- **tailwindcss**: A utility-first CSS framework.
- **vite**: Frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.

## Project Structure

- `/src`: Source files for the application.
- `/dist`: Output directory for the production build.
- `/node_modules`: Directory for NPM packages.
- `.env`: Environment variables file (ensure this file is not committed to version control).

## Environment Setup

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory to store environment-specific variables. The `dotenv` package is already included to help with this.

Example `.env` content:
